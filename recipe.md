Homemade Chocolate Bar Flavors
Crunchy Mint Chocolate: Add a few drops pure peppermint extract to the melted chocolate. For a fun texture, feel free to also add cacao nibs or rice crispy cereal.

Dark Chocolate Almond: Stir a handful of chopped almonds in with the other ingredients. This can also be done with diced walnuts, peanuts, or cashews.

Chocolate Coconut: Stir in a handful of shredded coconut, or sprinkle it over top before chilling the chocolate bars.

Chocolate Sea Salt: After pouring the melted chocolate into a container, sprinkle a small amount of sea salt on top.

Rocky Road: Add mini vegan marshmallows and chopped nuts of choice to the mixture before refrigerating or freezing.

Peanut Butter Swirl: After pouring the chocolate into a container, use a spoon to swirl in melted peanut butter or almond butter. Chill until firm.

Espresso Chocolate Bars: Stir 1/8 tsp instant coffee granules in with the cocoa. For a stronger coffee flavor, you can increase this amount as desired.
